Hi, I'm Ronald. I recently graduated from UC Berkeley, earning a Bachelor's
degree with majors in computer science, mathematics, and statistics.
I spend much of my unproductive time cooking or eating food, finding or drinking
<a href="{{ "/pmt" | prepend:site.baseurl }}">pearl milk tea</a>,
playing video games, and watching anime.

## Highlights

* You can find links to some of the projects I've worked on on the
<a href="{{ "/projects" | prepend:site.baseurl }}">projects page</a>.

* I've done some data analysis on my blog, on subjects including
<a href="{{ "/blog/ucb-eecs-lscs-admissions" | prepend:site.baseurl }}">
freshman admissions to the two CS-related majors at Berkeley</a> and
<a href="{{ "/blog/ucb-grade-distributions" | prepend:site.baseurl }}">
grade distributions for undergraduate courses at Berkeley</a>. I
expanded on the latter topic by contributing to a
<a href="http://projects.dailycal.org/grades/">visualization of
grade averages for the Daily Californian</a>.

* On the lighter side, I've also written about my experience with
<a href="{{ "/blog/berkeley-tea" | prepend:site.baseurl }}">tea-serving
establishments</a> and <a href="{{ "/blog/berkeley-food" | prepend:site.baseurl }}">
restaurants</a> during my four years as a student at Berkeley.
Delicious photos included.
