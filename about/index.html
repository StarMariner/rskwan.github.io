I'm an undergraduate student at <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>
studying computer science, mathematics, and statistics.
I spend much of my unproductive time cooking or eating food, finding or drinking
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_tea">pearl milk tea</a>,
and watching anime.
