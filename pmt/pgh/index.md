title: PMT in Pittsburgh
layout: page
---

In the summer of 2015, I began doing research as a
[uPNC fellow](http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/article/76-summercompneuro)
sponsored by the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition in Pittsburgh, PA.
At this point, I'd been completely hooked on PMT, and thus, as I did
[the summer before]({{ "/pmt/atl/" | prepend:site.baseurl }}),
I began seeking out PMT-serving establishments. Fortunately, this time,
more places were closer to where I was living (near the CMU and Pitt campuses),
rendering my second summer PMT adventure much less arduous.
