Welcome to the final (planned) installment of my reviews of PMT in
Pittsburgh! The subject of this post has actually been my most frequently
visited place serving PMT in the few weeks that I've spent here. It's
also quite rather different from the other places covered so far in a
number of ways.

[Chick'n Bubbly](http://www.yelp.com/biz/chickn-bubbly-pittsburgh-3) is
an Asian fusion-ish snack shop that focuses, like its title suggests, on
Korean-style fried chicken and PMT. It's the only place I've covered
that's closer to Pitt than to CMU, and it has a rather Western aesthetic
compared to the others.

I've ordered from here a number of times, getting some chicken wings and
drumsticks a couple of times (which taste pretty good but are of course
greasy and terrible for you). A nice thing is that if you order from
its neighboring restaurant
[Oishii Bento](http://www.yelp.com/biz/oishii-bento-pittsburgh),
which serves carryout Korean/Japanese-style meals, catered to college students
and busy people, you get a small discount on the PMT.

Speaking of PMT, the PMT I've tried here has generally been pretty solid,
at least compared to the abominations I've covered previously
(with the exception of Rose Tea Caf&eacute;), though not as
good as its Bay Area brethren. The pearls stood out among the ones I've
tried here as hitting pretty close to the right texture, and have some
flavor to them (though not as much as I'd like). The milk tea is strangely
nondescript, with a milky consistency, not too much sugar, and not
very strong tea; while it's certainly tolerable, it doesn't really leave
much of an impression. It still beats out all but Rose Tea Caf&eacute;
easily, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it, especially if you're
interested in a lunch from Oishii Bento.
