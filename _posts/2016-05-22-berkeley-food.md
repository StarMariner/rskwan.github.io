title: "A Brief Guide to Food in Berkeley"
date: 2016-05-22
---

While looking back at the photos I'd taken during my time as an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley, I thought it'd be fun to distill the experiences I've had eating at restaurants around Berkeley. So I wrote a couple sentences about each of the places I'm willing to endorse, though I've probably left a few out, and included sample photos where I could.

Side notes: It's pretty clear that I've eaten mostly Asian food, which is completely unsurprising to me. I've also refrained from adding tea shops to the list, since I haven't tried the one that just opened (Tea 1), and I have an explicit ranking for the best ones, which doesn't fit this format.

## Personal Favorites

You can find the reviews below. These aren't in any particular order.

* Brazil Cafe
* Heat Cafe
* Jayakarta
* KoJa Kitchen
* Simply Bowl

## Chinese

### Chengdu Style Restaurant
Specializes in Sichuan food; the toothpick lamb and boiled fish in hot sauce (what my friends call the "endless pot of fish") are popular. They have a WeChat account, so clearly they're authentic.

### Great China
Decent if you're looking for a nicer place to eat with your parents or for a date night. Pretty generic choices.

### Heat Cafe
A small friendly restaurant with homestyle Chinese (mostly Sichuan and Cantonese) food. I especially like their mapo tofu, braised pork belly, and Hong Kong milk tea.

## Japanese

### CU Sushi
A good compromise between the fancier Joshu-ya and the dirt cheap Tako. Standard choices, but well executed.

### Joshu-ya
Good sushi rolls and a variety of interesting entrees. More expensive than your standard student-oriented restaurant, but not by much.

### Tako Sushi
Cheap, but OK food. Not much else to say.

## Thai

### Imm
A little crowded and somewhat overhyped, but decent food. It has a hipster vibe and pretty standard dishes.

### Thai Noodle and Thai Noodle II
I personally like them more than Imm, since they're open later, usually not as crowded, and the portions are a bit bigger. Everything's good.

### Thai Basil
Cheap, greasy food aimed towards students. Their lunch special (when I had classes on Southside) was a pretty good deal.

## Other Notable Asian Food

### 85C Bakery (Taiwanese)
Asian breads, cakes, pastries, tea, and coffee. The baked goods are the focus here, but I appreciate their sea salt drinks. Though 85 is more expensive, I definitely like it better than Sheng Kee (the other Asian bakery in town).

### Bowl'd and Spoon (Korean)
Both of these are a bit far (Spoon is far west, Bowl'd is on Solano Ave and technically in Albany), but they offer very solid Korean food, especially their bibimbap.

### Jayakarta (Indonesian)
This is the place to go for Southeast Asian food. Service can be somewhat slow, but the food is great. I especially like their nasi lemak.

### KoJa Kitchen (Korean/Japanese)
Korean-Japanese fusion shop, known for their KoJas (sandwiches with rice buns instead of bread), which are cool but kind of expensive. I usually get one of the bowl combos.

### Simply Bowl (Hawaiian/Japanese)
Poke bowls are their specialty, though they do have a few more traditional Japanese rice/noodle dishes (gyudon, teriyaki chicken, yakisoba, etc.).

### Tasty Pot (Hot Pot)
Similar to Boiling Point. Everyone gets their own hot pot with pre-determined ingredients and soup flavors. Perfect for cold or rainy days.

### Toss (Fusion)
Choose a noodle, choose a sauce/soup, and choose a protein. Good for when you just want a big bowl of stir-fried noodles or noodle soup.

## Notable Non-Asian Food

### Bongo Burger
Classic burger joint. It's not In-N-Out, but the burgers are good in their own way. Definitely better than McDonald's.

### Brazil Cafe
Their tri-tip beef and cilantro garlic sauce are amazing. They have a food stand a block from campus, but there's also a sit-down version further down University.

### Cheese Board Pizza and Sliver
Obligatory. Sliver has a bar and TVs showing sports, while Cheeseboard has live music and a bread/cheese shop.

### Endless Summer Sweets
Their main feature is the funnel cakes. Guilty pleasure, but they're so, so good.

### Gregoire
Take-out French food. Great if you have a place to sit down or are willing to walk and eat.

### Ike's Love and Sandwiches
The sandwich I had (the Telegraph) was great; it's a shame that they opened right after I graduated.

### Little Gem Belgian Waffles
Does what it says in the title, and does it well. Good for dessert after eating next door at Pieology.

### Pieology
Chipotle for pizzas, or something like that. Not amazing, but it's nice to construct your own pizza.

### Smoke's Poutinerie
If you want a heart attack at 3am, you can get one here.
