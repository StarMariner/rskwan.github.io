After successfully finding a more-or-less decent PMT in Pittsburgh, I began
searching more for Asian food than for PMT, as there weren't many other notable
options on my list left to explore. Browsing a few more reviews, I noticed that
one restaurant that hadn't made it onto my list before actually had a number of
reviews with some opinion (whether good or bad) on the PMT.

The place in question,
[Everyday Noodles](http://www.yelp.com/biz/everyday-noodles-pittsburgh),
is more known for its food, and particularly its noodle-based dishes,
as might be expected from its name. A few of the Yelp reviews advised
prospective eaters that it would be packed on the weekend; luckily, my
schedule is flexible enough that I went on a Tuesday, and finding
seating wasn't hard at all. I ordered spicy wonton noodles, which were
quite good (if a little spicy for my tastes), and a standard PMT.

Unfortunately, the PMT just wasn't up to par. The milk tea tasted very
artificial, though I was grateful that they didn't add too much sugar
to the mixture. A couple of reviews suspected they used powder rather than
actual milk tea, and I wouldn't be surprised if that were the case.
The pearls were halfway decent, in that the texture wasn't too bad (somewhat
too firm), but they had little flavor to them. The PMT was just a boring
experience, and certainly not worth the $4.50 I paid for it, especially with
a significantly better candidate (Rose Tea Cafe) right across the street.
I recommend stopping by here for the food, but definitely not for the PMT.

*Update (June 18)*: After stopping by this place, I also went over to another
place, [Sichuan Gourmet](http://www.yelp.com/biz/sichuan-gourmet-pittsburgh),
with pretty much the same story and even the same price for the PMT. Sadly,
the PMT was pretty much identical to that of Everyday Noodles, so I decided
a full-fledged review wasn't worth it. I did upload a picture for this post,
though.
