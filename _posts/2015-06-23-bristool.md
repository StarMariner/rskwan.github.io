title: "BRISTool: Batch Reverse Image Search Tool"

For the past day or so, I've been working on a little web app, and
now I've released (admittedly barebones) working version of it!
It's called BRISTool (BRIS standing for Batch Reverse Image Search),
and it's built on [node.js](https://nodejs.org/). You can
find it live [on Heroku here](http://bristool.herokuapp.com/), and
you can also find all the code
[on GitHub](http://github.com/rskwan/bristool).

The motivation came during a puzzle hunt, where you try to solve as
many puzzles as quickly as possible, usually in teams. A couple of us
were bashing our heads against a puzzle with a lot of (unlabeled)
images that we guessed were important to the puzzle.
One of the usual things to do when you have images in a puzzle
is to put them into a reverse image search engine like
[Google Images](http://images.google.com/) or
[TinEye](http://tineye.com/). Doing this for a lot of images at once
is quite cumbersome, though, and hence, the idea for this tool
came into existence (at least in my mind).

What BRISTool does is pretty simple: take a bunch of images, send
each of them to a reverse image search service, and spit out the
links to the corresponding search pages. This turned to be a little
harder than I thought it would be, but I managed to finish up in
less than 24 hours, albeit with a very simple interface and
somewhat messy code. Not a bad way to spend a couple days.
(I'm blocked on my research project due to external factors,
so it's OK to not be working on it!)
