Hi, I'm Ronald. I'm an undergraduate student at
<a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>
studying computer science, mathematics, and statistics.
I spend much of my unproductive time cooking or eating food, finding or drinking
<a href="{{ "/pmt/" | prepend:site.baseurl }}">pearl milk tea</a>,
and watching anime.
